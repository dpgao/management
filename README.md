# NeoMutt Management

This repo is a collection of scripts and notes that help to automate the
day-to-day running of the [NeoMutt Project](http://www.neomutt.org).

## Travis

The [Travis scripts](https://github.com/neomutt/management/tree/master/travis)
are run automatically on each commit to a NeoMutt branch.  They perform a
variety of compiles to ensure nothing has been broken.
