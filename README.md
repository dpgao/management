# NeoMutt Management

This repo is a collection of scripts and notes that help to automate the
day-to-day running of the [NeoMutt Project](http://www.neomutt.org).

## Feature Templates

It's important for new features to be
[well-documented](https://github.com/neomutt/management/tree/master/template-docs).
To help new users, each NeoMutt feature comes with a **Chapter in the Manual**,
a **sample muttrc** and for Vim users a **vim syntax file** for config-file
highlighting.

These templates are helpful when making a release:

- check-repos.txt -- Which repos to check for credits
